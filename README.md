# Collaboration Station - Backend

### Project created using Ruby v2.6.1

You can install Ruby [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and Rails [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html) before starting, as you will need both of these. This is a Ruby-on-Rails backend.

### Installation instructions

- Fork and clone this repository into a place specified by you

- Navigate into that directory using your terminal

- Run `bundle install` to install dependencies

- Run `rails s` to run the Rails server. It will start on http://localhost:3000/ by default, and this is the port I used.

- Navigate to the [frontend directory]() and run that as well.
